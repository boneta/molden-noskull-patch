# No-Skull Patch for Molden ðŸ’€ðŸ›‡

Simple and dirty patch for [Molden](https://www.theochem.ru.nl/molden/), the ancient chemical/molecular viewer. Allows to close Molden without the need to click the annoying *Skull Icon*. Works for both the *control panel* and *main window*.

Tested on Molden 7.1 and gcc/gfortran 9.4 & 11.2 on a Linux machine.  
No warranty at all, although it is so simple that it should not break anything.


## Usage
1. Download the [source code](https://ftp.science.ru.nl/Molden/) of Molden and untar it
2. Apply the patch: `patch src/xwin.c noskull.diff`
3. Compile Molden
4. Run Molden
5. Close Molden without the skull icon!!!

#### Note
If your gfortran compiler is 10 or higher, you may need to add `-fallow-argument-mismatch` to the `FFLAGS` in the `makefile` before the compilation. This is an issue of *molden* itself, independent of the patch.


## Full and quick compilation example
```
wget https://ftp.science.ru.nl/Molden/molden7.1.tar.gz --no-check-certificate
